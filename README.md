# base16-st
[Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for
[st](http://st.suckless.org/).

## Installation
Either copy and paste the contents of the desired `.h` file into your st
`config.h`, or include the `.h` file in your `config.h`. Either way you'll
want to remove or comment out the original color settings in the configuration
file to ensure it does not over ride the settings from the theme.
